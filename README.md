## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **HTML Structure (ecommerce.html):**
   Static markup for header, product section, cart sidebar, and footer.

2. **CSS Styling (ecommerce.css):**
   Styles the layout, grid responsiveness, hover effects, and cart design.

3. **Interactive Logic (ecommerce.js):**

   * Adds items to a cart array on "Add to Cart" click
   * Updates cart UI (item count, cart overlay list, remove buttons)
   * Handles product filtering and search display if implemented
   * Toggles cart visibility and total price calculation

4. **Static Assets (images/):**
   Product thumbnails and hero visuals used across the site. ([GitHub][1])

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **HTML5** — Semantic structure for product pages
* **CSS3** — Custom styling with Flexbox/Grid and media queries
* **Vanilla JavaScript** — Manipulates DOM to manage cart interactions
* **Static images** — Local assets for product thumbnails and hero section ([GitHub][1])

     └── button.png        ← UI icons, cart triggers
```

## 🧰 Requirements & Setup

1. Clone the project to your local computer.
2. Open `ecommerce.html` directly in your browser (no installation required).
3. Interact by adding/removing items to/from the cart.
4. For further edits, modify `.html`, `.css`, or `.js` files and reload to preview changes.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add real dynamic data using JSON or backend APIs
* Persist cart state via localStorage or session
* Implement filtering options (category, price range, search)
* Add product details modals or dedicated detail pages
* Integrate basic checkout flow (form validation, summary page)
* Use frameworks (React, Vue) for component-based structure
* Add animations, transitions and responsive enhancements

## ✅ Quick Summary

Simple and clean static e-commerce front‑end that’s fully responsive, with client‑side cart interactions powered by JavaScript. Great for prototyping or learning front-end fundamentals.
